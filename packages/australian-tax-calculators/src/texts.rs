The operator establishes the base value under s 9(2) as the employer's guide (7.8.1) describes: cost_price holds the part the one-third reduction applies to (where the provider or an associate owned the car at the earliest holding time, its cost price to them with dealer delivery and non-business accessories fitted at acquisition; otherwise its leased car value then, which is the lessor's cost price only if the lessor bought the car when the lease began, and otherwise its arm's-length purchase price), and later_accessories holds non-business accessories added after acquisition, which it never reduces. one_third_reduction is true only from the FBT year starting after the car has been held for 4 years. Days used or available for private use, recipient's payments and whether the electric cars exemption applies are established facts. Excludes deciding whether a car benefit or exemption arises, the base value itself, arm's-length deeming, dealer demonstrator cars, the type 1 or type 2 choice, gross-up and FBT payable. Only the gross taxable value is rounded to cents, before the recipient's payment, which cannot take the taxable value below nil; an unused excess is shown and reduces no other benefit. An exempt electric car's taxable value is nil, and taxable_value_before_exemption is the notional value its reportable fringe benefits amount is worked out from, before gross-up.",

The operator establishes the GST-inclusive car expenses for the holding period under s 10(3) (repairs, maintenance and fuel, and registration and insurance attributable to the period, including those the employee paid, but not insured repair expenses, an owned car's registration and insurance incurred before the provider owned it, or expenses the lessor bears under the lease), the lease charges for a leased car, or for an owned car acquired on or after 10 May 2006 (a hire purchase car is owned) its s 12 depreciated value at the start of the FBT year (cost price less earlier FBT deemed depreciation, or its cost price if acquired in the year), the days in the holding period the car was owned or leased, the business use percentage from log book and odometer records (0 without them), recipient's payments, the same car's statutory formula value and whether the electric cars exemption applies. Deemed depreciation at 25% and deemed interest at the year's benchmark rate are apportioned to the days held. Non-business accessories fitted before the year belong in depreciated_value; accessories fitted during the year, a car both owned and leased in the year, a car neither owned nor leased by the provider, cars acquired before 10 May 2006, the business use estimate itself, arm's-length deeming, the type 1 or type 2 choice, gross-up and FBT payable are excluded. Only the gross taxable value is rounded to cents, before the recipient's payment, which cannot take the taxable value below nil; an unused excess is shown and reduces no other benefit. Under s 10(5) the result is the lower of this value and the statutory formula value supplied for the same car and holding period; gross_taxable_value, employee_contribution_applied and excess_employee_contribution are the operating cost method's figures, and where the statutory formula value is lower, fbt-car-statutory's applied and excess figures apply.
